# MineSweeper
This is a game for desktop, similar to Microsoft's Minesweeper.

This is one of my first projects in C#. It is a Minesweeper game, very similar to Microsoft's Minesweeper. As you start the game, you are presented with a grid of cells. Each cell either contains a mine or it doesn't. If you click a cell with a mine, you lose. If you click a cell without a mine, a number appears that tells you the number of cells containing mines that neighbor the cell. You can click new game to start a new game. Using the buttons in the menu at the top, you can change the size of the field, see how to play the game, or view highscores and game statistics.
To play the game, download the files, open them in Microsoft Visual Studio, and run the .exe file in bin/Debug.
